# LoFi-sampler
Designs for a simple DIY sampler using the ISD1820 IC with a lasercut enclosure.

This site has the files for a cool little looper/sampler project based around the ISD1820 “voice recorder” IC. It’s dirty and clicky but surprisingly endearing to play with. It is battery powered, built on a breadboard, and enclosed in a laser cut wooden box with buttons, a dial for varying playback speed/pitch, and speaker grill on the top face.

There are many similar designs for using this IC as a simple sampler, this is another. The laser cut enclosure is a bit more novel and affords portability, making it a handheld instrument that can record samples in the field and be played wherever you like.

This design by John Ferguson and Andrew R. Brown was developed for building as part of DIY electronic music workshops conducted for an Australian Research Council-funded [research project](https://www.regionalelectronicmusicaustralia.com/) exploring experimental electronic music in regional Australia.
