# lofi-sampler
A simple DIY sampler using the ISD1820 IC with a lasercut enclosure.

This site has the files for a cool little looper/sampler project based around the ISD1820 “voice recorder” IC. It’s dirty and clicky but surprisingly endearing to play with. It is battery powered, built on a breadboard, and enclosed in a laser cut wooden box with buttons, a dial for playback speed/pitch, and speaker grill on the top face.

There are many similar designs for using this IC as a simple sampler, this is another. The laser cut enclosure is a bit more novel and affords portability, making the instrument handheld for recording and playing wherever you like.

This design was developed for building in DIY electronic music workshops as part of an Australian Research Council-funded [research project](https://www.regionalelectronicmusicaustralia.com/) on experimental electronic music in regional Australia.
